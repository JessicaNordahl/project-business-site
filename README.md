# Business Site

This is a result of not having time to complete the task. I' tried to focus on the most important things to have in the website, such as an accordion etc. 
I am determand to catch-up!

This project was about making a business-site. I wanted to make a simple and easy approach. So I desited to make a site, where you can order your own rabbit.

I am having a hard time with the header and the following content. Thee following content was "under" the header and I spent alot oof time to figure out how to get it lower than the header. I googled and searched on Stachoverflow, yet I couldn't find any solution that was 100%, in the timelimit for the project.
